title: MTA Turnstile Data
---

The MTA publicly shares its turnstile data (link). In this post, I will use said data to determine the busiest places and times to be on the subway. One could use analysis like this to market to large crowds (or to avoid them!). I restrict my data set to the months of June, July and August of 2016.

To begin, let's see what the top 10 busiest stations are.

If you're familiar with New York City, you may know that our busiest station (34 ST-PENN), is HUGE. So while it carries the most passengers on average, it is not clear whether it offers the maximum audience in any one location. In particular one station often has several subway lines, which may be separated by some distance. Let's take a look at the busiest Station & Line combinations.

Notice, for example, that 23 ST doesn't even make the top 10 at the Station & Line level. For the final level of granularity, we can zoom in on subway entrances. One Station & Line combination may have several entrances. Below is the top 10 busiest *entrances*

What we did above was aggregated over every day in the entire summer. Surely there are patterns within that time period. First, let's find the busiest week in the summer.
