title: MTA Turnstile Data
---

The MTA publicly shares its [turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). In this post, I will use said data to determine the busiest places and times to be on the NYC subway. One could use analysis like this to market to large crowds (or to avoid them!). I restrict my data set to the months of June, July and August of 2016.

To begin, let's see what the top 10 busiest stations are.

If you're familiar with New York City, you may know that our busiest station (34 ST-PENN), is HUGE. So while it carries the most passengers on average, it is not clear whether it offers the maximum audience in any one location. In particular one station often has several subway lines, which may be separated by some distance. Let's take a look at the busiest Station & Line combinations.

Notice, for example, that 23 ST doesn't even make the top 10 at the Station & Line level. For the final level of granularity, we can zoom in on subway entrances. One Station & Line combination may have several entrances. Below are the top 10 busiest *entrances*

What we did above was aggregated over every day in the entire summer. Surely there are patterns within that time period. First, let's find the busiest week in the summer.

The 23rd week (June 6-12) of 2016 was the busiest. The dip in the 27th week is probably due to the 4th of July holiday. Overall, there is a modest decline from June to August. Next let's find the busiest days of the week.

Monday through Friday see about twice as much traffic as the weekends, with Tuesday through Thursday being the busiest (0=Monday). Finally, what's the busiest time of the day?

As expected, the morning and evening commutes see the most traffic, though we aggregated over every day of the week. Does the same pattern hold on the weekend?

It looks like most new yorkers don't feel the need to ride the subway before noon on the weekends.

So far, we've found the busiest week, and the busiest time of the day both on the weekends and during the week. Depending on the depth of the pockets of the company sponsoring the marketing and/or the tolerance for rejection of the buskers, we may want to strategize differently. Let's first assume deep pockets: let's assume our advertising street teams are going to hustle a 12 hour day. From above, we already know the best 12 hour windows for both the weekdays (08:00-20:00) and the weekends (12:00-24:00). Let's find the top 10 *entrances* to position them.

![weekend_12_hr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelaaroncantrell/michaelaaroncantrell.github.io/master/_posts/weekend_12_hr.png)
The first table above contains the weekday results, the second the weekend. It looks like people like to hang out around Washington Square on the weekends.

Now let's assume we can only afford to send people out for 4 hour windows. Here are the best 4 hour windows, first on the weekdays, then the weekends

![Weekday 4 Hour](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelaaroncantrell/michaelaaroncantrell.github.io/master/_posts/weekday_4_hr.png)
![Weekend 4 Hour](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelaaroncantrell/michaelaaroncantrell.github.io/master/_posts/weekend_4_hr.png)

Notice that there is a real strategic difference. For example, Grand Central makes the weekday cut during all hours considered, even in the 4 hour work day paradigm (though the entrance itself varies).

One thing that would be fun would be to use the entrance vs exits in the data to learn where people work. The idea would be that a station with a large exit to entrance ratio in the morning, Monday-Friday, would be a place of work. From there, we could target those locations around the lunch break (perhaps at busy intersections or parks).

Anyway, this concludes my first ever data science project! I'm looking forward to learning more advanced methods for analysis - all I did here was count. But hey, even simple counting offered some interesting and potentially useful insights in to subway usership.
